# flask-rephrasing-webserver
This project contains the code for a webserver that uses the googletrans library and the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library to modify a given text (in romanian) into a slightly different one.
The end-goal it's to get a text that's different from the original one without losing the original's meaning.
